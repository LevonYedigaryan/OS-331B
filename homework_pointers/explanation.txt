As I'm extremely bad at explaining my code and I think you would agree that explaining this homework is especially challanging I wrote an original unedited explanation you can find below entirely by myself without using any tools, if you can make anything out of it, then you can check it. But as at least to me it seems too challanging I fed my explanation to chatGPT and asked him to make it simpler. He didn't add anything to it or contribute to the explanation or to the code abyhow. I just desided to add it for your convenience. If you don't check anything generated by AI then please check my original explanation.

CHAT GPT SIMPLIFICATION OF MY EXPLANATION######

TASK 1 — Pointer Basics

You create an integer stored at some address.

Then you create a pointer that points to that address.

Using & with the integer gives its address.

The pointer itself already holds an address, so no & is needed.

You can change the value of the integer through the pointer using *.

Printing the integer directly or through *pointer gives the same value.

Key idea: & gets the address, * gets the value stored at an address.

TASK 2 — Pointers and Arrays

You create an array of integers.

You create a pointer to the first element of the array.

Using a loop, you can move the pointer along the array by adding the loop index.

You can change each array element by accessing it through *pointer + index.

You can print the array either directly using the array elements or using the pointer with *pointer + index.

Key idea: A pointer to an array can move along the array elements, just like indexing.

TASK 3 — Swapping Values with Pointers

You create two integers and pointers to them.

You print their values.

You call a function that swaps their values using pointers:

Access the value under each pointer with *.

Update the first value using the sum/difference trick.

Update the second value similarly.

Printing again shows that the two integers have swapped.

Key idea: Pointers allow a function to modify variables outside its own scope.

TASK 4 — Pointer to a Pointer

You create an integer and a pointer to it.

You create a pointer to the pointer (pointer-to-pointer).

Using *pointer gives the integer value.

Using **pointer-to-pointer also gives the integer value because:

The first * gets the pointer stored inside the pointer-to-pointer.

The second * gets the value the original pointer points to.

Key idea: A pointer-to-pointer lets you reach the original value through two levels of indirection.

TASK 5 — Character Array (String)

You create an array of characters to form a word.

You create a pointer to the first element of the array.

You count the length by looping until you find the special '\0' character (marks the end of the array).

In each loop, you access each character using *pointer + index.

Printing each element gives the word.

The final count gives the length of the word (excluding '\0').

Key idea: '\0' marks the end of a character array, and pointers can traverse it element by element.

MY VERSION#####################################

TASK 1========================================

I create an integer that is stored at some address. then I create a pointer that points to that address the integer is stored. with &p I print the address itself and the & in front of the integer's name indicates its address. Then I do the same thing for the pointer this time no need for & as the pointer is itself the address. then I access the value stored under the address pointed by the pointer using * and change it to 100. then I print the value by uisng the original integer, and then do the same thing by accessing it through the pointer again with the *. this time I use %d as I print not an address but the value itself.

TASK 2========================================

I create an array of integers and store the values in it. then I create a pointer to the array that points to the first element of the array (this is how the pointers work for the arrays in c). Then I run a loop with the number of iterations corresponding to the length of the array. each iteration I add the numer of the iteration to the pointer so it COrresponds to the element of the array corresponding to the nuber of iteration, access its value by using * and change it to the same number added 157. Then I print the array by iterating a loop over it and directly accessing the leement of the array by a[i] where i is the number of the iteration. Then I iterate one more time on the array but this time I access it using the pointer. Specifically I add the number of the iteration to the pointer as, as we remember the pointer points to the first element of the array, and access its value using *.

TASK 3========================================

main - I create two integers and pointers corresponding to them each. then I print the values of the integers, call a function, and then print the values again.

swap - I access the value under the address b with * and put there the sum of the values under a and b also accessed by *. Then I make the value under the address a equal to the difference of the values under b and a, accessing the values by *, which effectively ensures that the value under the address a is the initil value under b. then I do the same thing for b which effecitvely swappes the numbers.

TASK 4========================================

I create an integer and give it a vlaue. then I create a pointer (*) to the integer, I use & for the integer as I want its address and not value. Then I create a pointer to the pointer (**) and as I want the address of the pointer and not its value whihch is also an address but not the one I need I put & before the original pointer. I print the value of the integer using pointer by using * which effectively gives the value under the pointer address which is the integer itself. I use ** to access the integer value for the pointer-pointer because the first * gives the value of the address the pointer-pointer points to which is the original pointer, and the second * works on that pointer and gives the value that pointer pointes to which is the original value of the integer.

TASK 5========================================

As c doesn't have a String I create an array of chars and by arranging the values of each element I get the word I need ('Hello'). I then create a pointer to the array which as we already know points to the first element of the array. then I create an integer length which will count the length of th array. Then apparantly c creates an additional '\0' symbol at the end of char arrays which is very handy for me. I create a loop that checks whether the value of the pointer to the first element of the array plus the value of the length which will eventually point at the length'th element of the original array is equal to the '\0' which would mean the end of the array. each iteration I print the the length'th element of the array by adding length to the original pointer and accessing its value using *. As I need the char symbol itself and not the integer value or anything else I use &c. and at the end of each ieration I add 1 to the length so it effectively corresponds to the next element. at the end as I have started the computation of length from 0 and its final value corresponds to the '\0' which is next to the final element of the array this would mean that it would correspond to the length of the array counted from 1 and disregarding the finla '\0' thing, which is basically what I need, so I print itsvalue and become happy.
